## OpenMP Examples
### Prof. N. Stergioulas


The following example programs introduce the main concepts of OpenMP step by step.

### Part 1

1. **hello-world-parallel.c**

The most basic hello world executed in parallel.

2. **hello-world-parallel-id.c**

Similar to 1. but the id of each thread and the total number of threads are also printed.

3. **hello-world-parallel-id-func.c**

Same result as 2. but a function is called to print in inside the parallel region.

4. **hello-world-parallel-id-scope.c**

Same result as 2. but data scope is used in the parallel region.
